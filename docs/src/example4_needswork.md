# Modeling a Complex Food Web

In this example, we will simulate a complex food web consisting of multiple species, each with its own genotype-phenotype map. EvoDynamics.jl provides the flexibility to define custom evolutionary models and simulate the dynamics of populations in a spatially explicit environment.

## Research Question: Investigating the Role of Genotype-Phenotype Mapping in Ecological Stability

Research in evolutionary biology has highlighted the importance of genotype-phenotype mapping in shaping the dynamics and stability of ecological systems. By exploring the interplay between genetic variation, phenotypic traits, and species interactions, we can gain insights into the mechanisms underlying biodiversity, community dynamics, and ecosystem resilience.

In this context, our research question is: **How does the genotype-phenotype mapping of species influence the stability and dynamics of a complex food web?**

## Model Overview
The model will include the following components:

**Species**: We will define a set of species, each characterized by its genetic makeup, phenotypic traits, and interactions with other species in the food web.

**Genotype-Phenotype Mapping**: Each species will have a distinct genotype-phenotype map that determines how its genetic information is translated into observable traits.

**Spatial Environment**: The species will inhabit a spatially explicit environment, allowing for interactions and movement within the ecosystem.

**Species Interactions**: The species will interact with each other based on predefined ecological rules, such as predation, competition, or mutualism. These interactions will influence their fitness and population dynamics.

**Evolutionary Dynamics**: The genetic makeup of each species will evolve over time through processes such as mutation, genetic recombination, and natural selection.

## Implementation Steps

To simulate this complex food web model, we need to perform the following steps:

**Define Species and Genotype-Phenotype Mapping:** Specify the set of species in the food web and define their genotype-phenotype mapping, including the number of genes, phenotypic traits, mutation rates, and fitness functions.

**Initialize the Spatial Environment:** Set up the spatial environment in which the species will interact. Define the size, resources, and other environmental factors.

**Implement Species Interactions:** Define the ecological rules governing species interactions, such as predation, competition, or mutualism. These rules will determine the fitness of each species and their population dynamics.

**Simulate the Evolutionary Dynamics:** Run the simulation over multiple generations, allowing the species to evolve and adapt to their environment. Monitor the population dynamics, genetic changes, and phenotypic variations over time.

**Collect and Analyze Data:** Define custom data collection functions to monitor and analyze specific aspects of the model, such as species abundances, genetic diversity, or the stability of the food web. Use visualization and statistical analysis tools to gain insights from the simulation results.

## Conclusion

By leveraging the unique capabilities of EvoDynamics.jl, we can model and simulate complex food webs with distinct genotype-phenotype mappings for each species.
