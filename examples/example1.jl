# # Simplest model

# We can create and run simple Wright-Fisher simulations with EvoDynamics.jl. To that end, we define a single haploid species, in single region, with a single gene affecting a single phenotype. The values of parameters below are set arbitrarily.

using EvoDynamics

parameters = Dict(
  :L => (1),
  :P => (1),
  :R => (0.7),
  :C => nothing,
  :B => [[true]],
