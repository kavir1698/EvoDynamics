The order that you write these parameters does not matter.</p><ul><li><strong>name</strong>: a name for the species.</li><li><strong>number of genes</strong>: An <em>integer</em> for number of genes that the species has.</li><li><strong>ploidy</strong>: Either 1 for haploid or 2 for diploid genomes. Diploids can have recombination.</li><li><strong>number of phenotypes</strong>: An <em>integer</em> for the number of phenotypes that the species has.</li><li><strong>abiotic phenotypes</strong>: An <em>array of integers</em> (e.g. &quot;[1,2]&quot;) specifying abiotic phenotypes among all phenotypes. Abiotic phenotypes determine how the species interacts with the environment.</li><li><strong>biotic phenotypes</strong>: An <em>array of integers</em> (e.g. &quot;[3]&quot;) specifying biotic phenotypes among all phenotypes. Biotic phenotypes determine how the species interacts with other individuals from the same or different species.</li><li><strong>migration phenotype</strong>: An <em>integer</em> specifying the phenotype that determines migration trait. If the species does not migrate, put 0.</li><li><strong>migration threshold</strong>: The phenotypic value of the migration phenotype after which an individual can migrate.</li><li><strong>vision radius</strong>: A <em>number</em> determining the radius of neighboring sites that the agent can see before migration.</li><li><strong>check fraction</strong>: A <em>number</em> between 0 and 1 showing the fraction of the visible sites to the agent that it can check and decide whether to migrate to.</li><li><strong>epistasis matrix</strong>: An epistasis matrix is of size <span>$l \times l$</span>, where <em>l</em> is the product of <em>number of genes</em> and <em>ploidy</em>. Epistasis matrix specifies the direction (positive or negative) and size of effect of one locus on other loci. For example, if at row 1 and column 2 is a value 0.2, it means that locus 1 affects locus 2 by increasing the effect of locus 2 (because its positive) with 20% of the effect of locus 1.</li><li><strong>pleiotropy matrix</strong>: A <em>binary matrix</em> (0s and 1s) with size <em>number of phenotypes</em> times <em>l</em>. The pleiotropy matrix specifies the phenotypes that each locus affects.</li><li><strong>expression array</strong>: A <em>vector</em> of size <em>l</em> that represent the expression amount of each locus determining its effect size.</li><li><strong>growth rate</strong>: Mean of a Poisson distribution for number of offsprings per reproduction. This number is the maximum mean when fitness of a haploid individual is 1, or the distance between the biotic phenotypes of two diploid individuals is 0.</li><li><strong>selection coefficient</strong>: A number between 0 and 1 that determines the importance of fitness. 0 would be a model without selection.</li><li><strong>mutation probabilities</strong>: A <em>vector of three numbers</em> each of which specifies the probability for a different type of mutations: mutation probability of the <em>expression array</em>, <em>pleiotropy matrix</em>, and <em>epistasis matrix</em>, respectively.</li><li><strong>mutation magnitudes</strong>: A <em>vector of numbers</em> with the same size as <em>mutation probabilities</em> that determines the magnitude of mutation for each of the three categories. Specifically, the numbers are the variances of normal distributions with mean 0 for expression array and epistasis matrices, and probability of changing a 0 and 1 in in the pleiotropy matrix.</li><li><strong>N</strong>: A <em>vector of integers</em> for the initial number of individuals at each site.</li><li><strong>environmental noise</strong>: A number for the variance of a normal distribution with mean 0 that will be added to the phenotypes.</li><li><strong>optimal phenotypes</strong>: Name of a function that returns a <em>vector of integers</em> for optimal phenotypes of the species at a specific site.  The vector should be as long as there are <code>abiotic phenotypes</code>. The function should have two arguments: <code>site</code>of type <code>Tuple{Int, Int}</code>and <code>model</code>of type <code>ABM</code>from the <code>Agents.jl</code>package. The definition of the function should be in a file referred to in the <code>functions file</code> parameter (see blow). This function can be time dependent.</li><li><strong>age</strong>: An <em>integer</em> for maximum age of individuals of this species.</li><li><strong>reproduction start age</strong>: The age at which individuals can reproduce.</li><li><strong>reproduction end age</strong>: The age after which individuals cannot reproduce.</li><li><strong>recombination</strong>: Mean of a Poisson distributions for number of crossing overs per sexual reproduction.</li><li><strong>initial energy</strong>: A parameter for parental care of infants. Values more than 0 indicate that newly born individuals can survive for a number of times without requiring food from the environment/other species. The consumption rate (i.e. how many generations this initial energy suffices) is determined by the sum of the corresponding rows in &quot;food sources&quot; model parameter.</li><li><strong>bottleneck function</strong>: Name of a function in <code>functions file</code> that accepts two arguments: <code>agent</code> and <code>model</code>. It returns true or false, where true means the agent is killed. This function models killing agents due to a process above the dynamics of the model, for example, hunting or environmental disaster. Since it accepts both the agent and the model, there are information about the position of the agent, its properties, and the time step of the simulation to take into account.</li></ul><h3 id="Model-parameters"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Model-parameters">Model parameters</a><a id="Model-parameters-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Model-parameters" title="Permalink"></a></h3><ul><li><strong>generations</strong>: An <em>integer</em> for the number of steps the model will run.</li><li><strong>space</strong>: A <em>vector of two integers</em> that determine the size of a grid for space.</li><li><strong>metric</strong>: Either &quot;chebyshev&quot; or &quot;euclidian&quot;. Determines how many neighbors a space site has. &quot;chebyshev&quot; metric means that the r-neighborhood of a position are all positions within the hypercube having side length of 2*floor(r) and being centered in the origin position. &quot;euclidean&quot; metric means that the r-neighborhood of a position are all positions whose cartesian indices have Euclidean distance ≤ r from the cartesian index of the given position.</li><li><strong>periodic</strong>: _Boolean__ (true or false) to determine whether boundaries of the space are connected or not.</li><li><strong>resources</strong>: A function that returns a <em>vector of integers</em> determining available resources (e.g. vegetation) per site. The function takes the <code>time_step</code> as its only argument. The function is defined in the functions file (parameter blow).</li><li><strong>functions file</strong>: Name of a file that contains the functions referred to in the <code>resources</code>, <code>bottleneck function</code> and <code>optimal phenotypes</code> parameters. If the file is in the same directory as this parameters file, writing its name is enough. Otherwise, a path should be given.</li><li><strong>interactions</strong>: A species-species interaction <em>matrix of numbers</em> determining how individuals from different species interact. Each value  is strength of interaction (between 0 and 1). Sign (+/-) is the direction of interaction where positive means similar individuals interact more strongly and negative is dissimilar ones tend to interact more.</li><li><strong>food sources</strong>: A species-species food <em>matrix of numbers</em> determining what each species feeds on (consumption rate). Non-zero diagonal means the food resource is from the environment. Off-diagonals mean an species (in the rows) feeds on another species (in the columns). Numbers can be zero or any positive number. The magnitude of the number determines how many generations can an individual live off of given one unit of the food source. For example, if a diagonal is 2, it means that the species will eat one unit of the environmental resources and that is enough for it to live two steps.</li><li><strong>seed</strong>: Either an <em>integer</em> or <em>Null</em> for random number generator seed.</li></ul><h2 id="Simulation-outline"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Simulation-outline">Simulation outline</a><a id="Simulation-outline-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Simulation-outline" title="Permalink"></a></h2><p>The simulations are fully agent-based, meaning that agents do not receive any model-level knowledge for what happens to them.

If it is, then the agent checks a random <em>check fraction</em> of the sites neighboring it and moves to the most suitable site. Suitability is calculated by comparing the agent&#39;s abiotic phenotype and the optimal abiotic phenotypic value for each site. If the checked neighbors have worse conditions than the current site, the agent does not move.</p><h3 id="Burn-energy"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Burn-energy">Burn energy</a><a id="Burn-energy-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Burn-energy" title="Permalink"></a></h3><p>Agent&#39;s energy is reduced by one unit.</p><h3 id="Eat"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Eat">Eat</a><a id="Eat-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Eat" title="Permalink"></a></h3><p>If the agent is able to eat from the environment (the diagonal of <em>food sources</em> at the corresponding row and column is non-zero) and there is any environmental resources left at the agent&#39;s site, then its energy level is boosted by as much as the value in the corresponding element at <em>food sources</em>.</p><h3 id="Interacting-with-other-individuals"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Interacting-with-other-individuals">Interacting with other individuals</a><a id="Interacting-with-other-individuals-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Interacting-with-other-individuals" title="Permalink"></a></h3><p>At each time, the agent interacts with as many agents as there are species in the model. If there are fewer agents in the site than number of species, the agent interacts with all of them. Otherwise, it interacts with at most one randomly picked individual from each species. If most of the individuals at the site are from the first species, then it is more likely that the agent interacts with an individual from the first species and with no individual from the second species. This set up allows interactions between species be dependent on the population size of the species at each site.</p><p>For each pair of interacting individuals, we first check whether one individual feeds on the other one. If so, the hunt is successful with a probability proportional to the average phenotypic distance between the biotic phenotypes of the two individuals.</p><p>Phenotypic distance between two species depends on the sign of the corresponding element in <em>interactions</em> matrix. If it is negative, then the hunt is more successful if the average phenotype of the two individuals is more different.</p><p>The phenotypic distance between two individuals is the average distance between all pairs of biotic phenotypes between the two individuals. To calculate the distance between two phenotypic values, we use the following formula:</p><p>$ | 0.5 - \text{cdf}(\text{Normal}(\text{ph1},  1), \text{ph2})| $</p><p>, where cdf is cumulative density function, Normal is a normal distribution with mean ph1 (phenotypic value 1) and variance 1, and ph2 is phenotypic value 2.</p><p>If the two individuals are not predator-prey, and they are from the same species but different sexes and they are both in reproduction age, then they try to reproduce. Otherwise, if they are from different species and the two species interact with each other (the corresponding values in the <em>interactions</em> matrix is non-zero) they interact with each other. If the individual 1 to 2 has a positive value in the <em>interactions</em> matrix, then it increases the fitness of individual 2.  If the element is zero, it does not increase or decrease the fitness of individual 2. And it the element is negative, it decreases the fitness of individual 2. Similarly, individual 2 can affect the fitness of individual 1. The two interactions do not need to be symmetric. The magnitude of change in the fitness due to interaction is determined by the phenotypic distance between the two individuals and interaction value in the <em>interactions</em> matrix.</p><h3 id="Reproduction"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Reproduction">Reproduction</a><a id="Reproduction-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Reproduction" title="Permalink"></a></h3><p>If an individual is haploid and is in reproduction age, it reproduces an identical offspring to itself except that the expression array, pleiotropy matrix, and the epistasis matrix of the offspring will mutate given the probabilities and magnitudes in the <em>mutation probabilities</em> and <em>mutation magnitudes</em> matrices. The number of offsprings is a random number from a Poisson distribution with a mean equal to the species&#39; growth rate times the fitness of the individual.</p><p>If two diploid individuals are mated to reproduce, their reproduction success is proportional to their phenotypic similarity. Number of offsprings is a random number from a Poisson distribution with mean equal to the reproduction success of the two individuals times the growth rate of the species.</p><p>Each offspring of diploid individuals inherits a gamete from each parent. A gamete is a half of the expression array, pleiotropy matrix, and epistasis matrix. If recombination is allowed (&gt; 0), then the gametes undergo crossing over. The number of crossing overs is a random number from a Poisson distribution with mean equal to the <em>recombination</em> parameter.</p><h4 id="Survival"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Survival">Survival</a><a id="Survival-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Survival" title="Permalink"></a></h4><p>At each step, the agent may die due to several factors. First, it dies if it has negative energy (has not been able to eat enough). Second, it dies if it is too old (&gt; max age). Third, it dies with a probability negatively correlated to its fitness. This probability is adjusted to the <em>selection coefficient</em>. If the selection coefficient is zero, then the individual does not die. If it is one, the fitness determines survival 100%.</p><h4 id="Fitness"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Fitness">Fitness</a><a id="Fitness-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Fitness" title="Permalink"></a></h4><p>Fitness of individuals is their abiotic fitness, i.e. their abiotic phenotypic distance to the optimal phenotypes in the environment. As such, their fitness can be different at different sites.</p><h4 id="Mutation"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Mutation">Mutation</a><a id="Mutation-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Mutation" title="Permalink"></a></h4><p>Mutation can happen at three levels: changing the expression of each gene, changing the pleiotropy matrix, and changing the epistasis interactions between genes. The probability that a mutation occurs at each of these levels is controlled by parameter <em>mutation probabilities</em>. And size of mutations when they occur are controlled by the <em>mutation magnitudes</em> parameters, which are the variances of a normal distribution. A mutation in gene expression and epistasis matrix is carried by adding a random number from a normal distribution to the existing values. The pleiotropy matrix is mutated by switching 0s and 1s with the probability given in the third element of <em>mutation magnitudes</em>.</p></article><nav class="docs-footer"><a class="docs-footer-prevpage" href="../">« Introduction</a><a class="docs-footer-nextpage" href="../tutorial/">Tutorial »</a><div class="flexbox-break"></div><p class="footer-message">Powered by <a href="https://github.com/JuliaDocs/Documenter.jl">Documenter.jl</a> and the <a href="https://julialang.org/">Julia Programming Language</a>.</p></nav></div><div class="modal" id="documenter-settings"><div class="modal-background"></div><div class="modal-card"><header class="modal-card-head"><p class="modal-card-title">Settings</p><button class="delete"></button></header><section class="modal-card-body"><p><label class="label">Theme</label><div class="select"><select id="documenter-themepicker"><option value="documenter-light">documenter-light</option><option value="documenter-dark">documenter-dark</option></select></div></p><hr/><p>This document was generated with <a href="https://github.com/JuliaDocs/Documenter.jl">Documenter.jl</a> version 0.27.20 on <span class="colophon-date" title="Tuesday 12 July 2022 12:28">Tuesday 12 July 2022</span>.
